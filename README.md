🌎 Pacha Wayra

Smart Climate and Cultural Discovery Platform for Peru

🚀 Summary

Pacha Wayra is an interactive web platform that connects travelers with the natural and cultural essence of Peru through climate intelligence and personalized recommendations.
Our system integrates NASA’s MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets and TensorFlow-based predictive models to forecast key atmospheric variables and provide intelligent travel suggestions.

Beyond forecasting, Pacha Wayra embraces cultural discovery by suggesting regional activities, foods, and drinks, offering users an immersive and safe travel experience powered by real-time data visualization and AI-assisted recommendations.

🧭 Project Overview

Pacha Wayra provides real-time climate forecasts and smart travel recommendations for all Peruvian regions.
The platform predicts seven key atmospheric variables — temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, precipitation, and more — using machine learning models trained on NASA MERRA-2 datasets.

Key Features

🌤️ Real-time climate forecasting using NASA datasets

🧠 Machine learning model trained in TensorFlow

🗺️ Interactive maps built with Leaflet

📈 Dynamic weather visualizations using Recharts

📄 PDF report generation for user-selected destinations

💬 Prototype chatbot for real-time user assistance

🍲 Cultural recommendations (local foods, drinks, activities)

⚙️ How It Works

The system integrates multiple modern web technologies for smooth performance and interactivity:

Component	Technology
Frontend Framework	React + Vite
Styling	Tailwind CSS
Navigation	React Router DOM
Mapping	Leaflet + React-Leaflet
Charts & Visualization	Recharts
Animation	Framer Motion
Icons	Lucide React
Document Generation	jsPDF
Machine Learning	TensorFlow + scikit-learn + pandas (Python)
Data Source	NASA MERRA-2 Datasets (/M2T1NXFLX.5.12.4/, /M2I1NXASM.5.12.4/)

Model training and data preprocessing were conducted on Google Colab, leveraging open NASA datasets for reliability and accessibility.

Data from NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (MERRA-2 Collections).

🎨 Creativity and Design

The design philosophy behind Pacha Wayra balances scientific accuracy with aesthetic simplicity.
We focused on clean, interactive, and accessible interfaces that communicate complex environmental data in an intuitive way.

Highlights:

Minimalist yet dynamic visuals

Framer Motion animations for smooth transitions

Responsive layouts for all devices

Consistent thematic colors inspired by Peruvian landscapes

🔮 Future Work

Pacha Wayra will continue evolving with the following improvements:

💬 Integration of a fully functional chatbot for personalized recommendations

☁️ Enhanced real-time AI prediction capabilities

👤 User profiles and travel history tracking

📱 Development of a mobile version for broader accessibility

🧠 Challenge Context

NASA Space Apps Challenge: “Will It Rain On My Parade?”
Participants were asked to develop an app capable of predicting the likelihood of “very hot,” “very cold,” “very windy,” “very wet,” or “very uncomfortable” conditions for any given time and location.

Pacha Wayra fulfills this challenge by combining real-time climate prediction with cultural enrichment, helping users plan safe, authentic, and memorable experiences.
